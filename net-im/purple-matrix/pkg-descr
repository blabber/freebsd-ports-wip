purple-matrix is a plugin for libpurple which adds the ability to communicate
with matrix.org homeservers to any libpurple-based clients (such as Pidgin).

This project is somewhat alpha, and only basic functionality has been
implemented. Sending and receiving simple text messages is supported, as is
joining rooms you are invited to by other users.
